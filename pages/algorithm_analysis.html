            In the realm of computer science, algorithms are fundamental building blocks that dictate how problems are solved and tasks are executed. An algorithm is essentially a well-defined sequence of instructions that takes an input, processes it, and produces an output. These procedures can vary widely in complexity and application, ranging from simple arithmetic operations to intricate data processing and optimization tasks. <br>
            As technology advances and data volumes grow, the efficiency of these algorithms becomes increasingly critical. This is where algorithm analysis comes into play. Algorithm analysis involves evaluating the performance and efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. By understanding how algorithms behave with different input sizes, developers and engineers can make informed decisions about which algorithms to implement in their systems.<br>
            A deep understanding of algorithm analysis is a cornerstone of effective programming. By dissecting algorithms, programmers can identify bottlenecks and optimize performance. This skill is crucial in today's resource constrained world, where efficient algorithms can lead to significant cost savings and improved user experiences. From novice to expert, every programmer should strive to develop the intuition to recognize and rectify inefficient algorithms.<br>In this article I will elucidate about how to determine efficiency of an algorithm.
